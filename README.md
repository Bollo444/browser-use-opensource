This project builds upon the foundation of the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), which is designed to make websites accessible for AI agents.

We would like to officially thank [WarmShao](https://github.com/warmshao) for his contribution to this project.

**WebUI:** is built on Gradio and supports most of `browser-use` functionalities. This UI is designed to be user-friendly and enables easy interaction with the browser agent.

**Expanded LLM Support:** We've integrated support for various Large Language Models (LLMs), including: Google, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama etc. And we plan to add support for even more models in the future.

**Custom Browser Support:** You can use your own browser with our tool, eliminating the need to re-login to sites or deal with other authentication challenges. This feature also supports high-definition screen recording.

**Persistent Browser Sessions:** You can choose to keep the browser window open between AI tasks, allowing you to see the complete history and state of AI interactions.
